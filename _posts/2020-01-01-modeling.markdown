My main interest and focus are in modeling and I'm doing it part-time since 2015.
Modeling is an art form I deeply love.

I used to think it was just about being in front of the camera, but it's also about you, your body, how you present yourself, whom you wear, and whom you identify with.
Under different lights, lenses, and creative direction, modeling gives me a chance to become a different person, one shutter clicks at a time. 

I celebrate my identity as a woman of color and align myself with brands that do the same.
